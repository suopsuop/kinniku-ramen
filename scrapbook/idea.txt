1. 
You play as a spirit for hire that is possessing the crown jester, but your king's kingdom has recently been bombarded with various spirits that have been tasked with discretely killing the king, by possessing the king's regular visitors. you must play simple minigames while sussing out the visitors of the court, and stopping them before they can kill the king.

start out with the king talking to you through a spirit medium, he tells you there are evil spirits trying to kill him and he wants to hire you to stop them. he says to possess his jester so as not to spook his guests.

you play the game by completing a series of events, laid out on the calender. e.g. farmer's plea, dinner with the french, etc. you have to guess who is a normal person and who is possessed, and act accordingly.
